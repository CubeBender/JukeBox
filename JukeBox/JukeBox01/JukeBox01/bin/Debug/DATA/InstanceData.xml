        'Cause this life's too long
        And this love's too strong
        So baby know for sure
        That I'll never let you go

        I got my favorite girl
        Not feelin', no pain, no fear
        Don't have a care in the world
        Why would I when you are here?
        There's a moment I've been chasing
        And I finally caught it out on this floor.
        Baby, there's no hesitation, no reservation
        By taking a chance and more, oh no, because...
